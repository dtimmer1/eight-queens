#Eight Queens

Uses a simple genetic algorithm to generate solutions for the "Eight Queens" puzzle.

##Background

The Eight Queens puzzle is often used as a test of algorithm effectiveness  The question is simple - given an n x n chessboard, construct a position with n queens on the board such that no two queens attack each other (i.e. no two queens are on the same row, column, or diagonal).

Genetic algorithms simulate the biological processes of natural selection and reproduction to find an optimal solution to a problem. Here, this genetic algorithm provides solutions for n x n (up to n = 12) size chessboards, and prints out a simple ASCII rendering of a chessboard with the queens in their given positions.
